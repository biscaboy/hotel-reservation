# Hotel Reservations 
Udacity Java Programming Nanodegree Programming Assignment 1

## Overview
This exercise acquaints the programmer with the fundamentals of the Java 
programming language.  The program has a command line interface that 
presents a main menu and an administrative menu to create Customers, 
Rooms and Reservations.  

## Requirements
* Create a customer 
* Search for rooms
* Book a room
* View reservations
* Display all customers
* View all the hotel rooms
* View all the hotel reservations
* Add a room to the hotel

## Notes
* JUnit - In addition to a Driver class that includes a few tests for the application, 
I also included a suite of JUnit tests that were not required.

* Maven - I used Maven to create an executable jar so that the 
application is easy to package and run in terminal window 
To include JUnit libraries.

    To Build Run
        
        mvn package
        
    To Run
        
        java -jar target/hotelreservation-0.1.1.jar
